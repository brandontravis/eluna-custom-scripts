# Advanced Travelers Beacon System - Complete Overview

## üéØ **System Purpose & Vision**

The Advanced Travelers Beacon System transforms the simple single-location beacon into a **comprehensive tiered progression system** that grows with players from level 1 to 80. This system provides increasingly powerful teleportation options while maintaining balanced resource management and professional integration.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **Progressive Tier System**
Instead of a single beacon type, the system offers **7 distinct beacon tiers** with unique capabilities:

| Tier | Beacon Type | Level Req | Max Locations | Rune Cost | Quality | Price |
|------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Starter | 1 | 1 | 1 per location | Common | 5g |
| 2 | Basic | 15 | 3 | 1 per location | Uncommon | 25g |
| 3 | Enhanced | 30 | 5 | 1 per location | Rare | 75g |
| 4 | Superior | 45 | 7 | 1 per location | Epic | 175g |
| 5 | Master | 60 | 10 | 1 per location | Epic | 375g |
| 6 | Advanced | 70 | 5 | **Fixed 1 rune** | Epic | 750g |
| 7 | Ultimate | 80 | 10 | **Fixed 1 rune** | Legendary | 2500g |

### **Key Innovation: Efficiency Tiers**
- **Normal Beacons (1-5):** Cost scales with stored locations (5 locations = 5 runes)
- **Efficiency Beacons (6-7):** Fixed 1 rune cost regardless of stored locations

## ‚ö° **Advanced Features**

### **üîß Smart Rune Management**
- **Scalable Costs:** Early beacons cost 1 rune per stored location
- **Emergency Purchase:** Auto-buy runes at 5x cost when out of reagents
- **Efficiency Progression:** Advanced tiers provide fixed low costs

### **üõ°Ô∏è Combat & Safety Systems**
- **10-second interruptible cast time** with visual channeling
- **Combat protection:** Cannot use while in combat
- **30-second cooldown** prevents spam usage
- **Location validation:** Blocks teleports to instances/battlegrounds
- **Coordinate safety checks:** Prevents invalid or exploitative locations

- **Tiered access:** Higher tier beacons locked behind level requirements
- **Reagent economy:** "Runes of Teleportation" at 50 silver each
- **Emergency pricing:** 2.5 gold for emergency rune purchases

### **üíæ Advanced Database Architecture**

#### **Player Progress Tracking**
```sql
player_beacon_progress:
- guid (player ID)
- beacon_level (current tier)
- content_packs (bitfield for future expansions)
- last_updated (progress tracking)
```

#### **Location Storage**
```sql
player_beacon_locations:
- guid + beacon_item_id + location_slot (composite key)
- location_name, coordinates, orientation
- location_type (manual/dungeon/raid)
- auto_discovered flag
- content_pack_id (for future features)
```

## üéÆ **User Experience Flow**

### **First Time Usage**
1. Player uses beacon item
2. **Auto-save confirmation:** "Set current location as recall point?"
3. Location stored with zone name auto-detection
4. Success message with usage instructions

### **Advanced Usage**
1. Player uses beacon ‚Üí **Gossip menu appears**
2. **Dynamic options based on stored locations:**
   - "Recall to [Location Name]" (for each saved location)
   - "Set New Location" (if slots available)
   - "Manage Locations" (rename/clear/reorganize)
   - "Cancel"

### **Teleportation Process**
1. Select destination from menu
2. **Rune cost calculation** displayed
3. **Emergency rune offer** if insufficient reagents
4. **10-second channeling** with visual effects
5. **Instant teleportation** on completion
