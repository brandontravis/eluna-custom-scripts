# Traveler's Beacon System - Core Design Document

## üéØ **Core Vision**

Create a **teleportation and portal system** that makes travel across Azeroth much more friendly for players. The system starts simple and grows with player progression, eventually expanding into portal creation and dungeon/raid access.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Core System Requirements**

### **Base Functionality**
- **One beacon item** that stores recall locations
- **Open world teleportation** to almost any location in Azeroth
- **Restricted areas:** Cannot teleport to PvP battlegrounds, inside dungeons, arenas, raids
- **Progressive upgrades** that add more location slots as players level

### **Upgrade Progression**
- **Level-based upgrades** at key progression points (20, 40, etc.)
- **Capacity expansion** through upgrade mechanic or direct item replacement
- **Advanced features** unlocked at higher levels (portals, dungeon access)

---

## üéÆ **Recommended Implementation**

### **Beacon Capacity Tiers**

| Tier | Name | Level Req | Max Locations | Upgrade Cost |
|------|------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Traveler's Beacon** | 1 | 1 | Starting item |
| 2 | **Dual Anchor Beacon** | 20 | 2 | Expensive |
| 3 | **Travel Network Beacon** | 40 | 5 | Very Expensive |
| 4 | **Master's Travel Beacon** | 60 | 10 | Extremely Expensive |

### **Functionality Upgrades** *(Independent of Capacity)*

| Upgrade | Availability | Requirements | Features |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Portal Casting** | Level 30 | Mage Portal Level + 10 | Create portals for others |
| **Dungeon Access** | Level 15 | Entry-level dungeons | Teleport to visited dungeons |
| **Raid Access** | Level 60 | End-game content | Teleport to visited raids |
| **Capital Networks** | Level 25 | Cross-faction access | Instant teleports to all major cities |
| **World Events** | Level 35 | Seasonal content | Access to event-specific locations |

### **Two-Path Upgrade System**

#### **Path 1: Capacity Upgrades** *(Expensive, Level-Gated)*
- **Item replacement system:** Buy new beacon, locations transfer automatically
- **High cost barriers:** Significant gold investment required
- **Level gates:** Must reach minimum level to purchase
- **Name changes:** Beacon name reflects current capacity tier

#### **Path 2: Functionality Upgrades** *(Moderate Cost, Early Access)*
- **Add-on system:** Upgrades apply to any capacity beacon
- **Lower level requirements:** Available much earlier than capacity upgrades
- **Beacon name unchanged:** Functionality doesn't affect beacon naming
- **Stackable:** Can have multiple functionality upgrades on one beacon

### **Feature Progression Examples**

#### **Level 15 Player with Traveler's Beacon (1 location)**
- Can purchase **Dungeon Access** upgrade
- Beacon name remains "Traveler's Beacon"
- Now has: 1 manual location + dungeon teleports

#### **Level 30 Player with Dual Anchor Beacon (2 locations)**
- Can purchase **Portal Casting** upgrade
- Beacon name remains "Dual Anchor Beacon"  
- Now has: 2 manual locations + portal creation

#### **Level 60 Player with Travel Network Beacon (5 locations)**
- Can have **multiple functionality upgrades**: Portal + Dungeon + Raid + Capital Networks + World Events
- Beacon name remains "Travel Network Beacon"
- Feature set: 5 manual locations + portals + instance access + capitals + events

#### **Level 70 Player with Master's Travel Beacon (10 locations)**
- Can have **all functionality upgrades**: Portal + Dungeon + Raid + Capital + Events
- Beacon name: "Master's Travel Beacon"
- Full feature set: 10 manual locations + all advanced functionality

---

## üí∞ **Resource Management**

### **Simple Reagent + Cooldown System**
- **Dual reagent type:** "Traveler's Mark" or similar for Teleports, "Portal Mark" or simsilar for portal creation
- **Cost scaling:** 1 rune per use
- **Vendor availability:** Purchasable from beacon vendor
- **Reasonable pricing:** ~50 silver per Mark, stackable to 200
- **Cooldown-based:** 15 minute cooldown per use

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Database Design**

### **Core Tables**

#### **Player Beacon Progress**
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_beacon_progress (
  guid INT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY,
  beacon_tier TINYINT UNSIGNED DEFAULT 1,
  has_portal_upgrade BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  has_dungeon_upgrade BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  has_raid_upgrade BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  has_capital_upgrade BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  has_events_upgrade BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### **Beacon Locations**
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_beacon_locations (
  guid INT UNSIGNED,
  location_slot TINYINT UNSIGNED,
  location_name VARCHAR(100),
  map_id INT UNSIGNED,
  position_x FLOAT,
  position_y FLOAT,
  position_z FLOAT,
  orientation FLOAT,
  location_type ENUM('manual', 'dungeon', 'raid') DEFAULT 'manual',
  PRIMARY KEY (guid, location_slot)
);
```

#### **Instance Discovery** *(For Tier 5)*
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_instance_discovery (
  guid INT UNSIGNED,
  map_id INT UNSIGNED,
  instance_type ENUM('dungeon', 'raid'),
  first_entered TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (guid, map_id)
);
```

## ‚ú® **Functionality Upgrade Details**

### **Capital Networks** *(Level 25)*
- **Instant access** to all major capital cities (Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc.)
- **Cross-faction availability** for neutral characters
- **Separate menu section** with organized city listings
- **No discovery requirement** - all capitals available immediately

### **World Events** *(Level 35)*
- **Seasonal locations** during active world events (Darkmoon Faire, seasonal events)
- **Event-specific teleports** to holiday locations (Hallow's End, Winter Veil areas)
- **Dynamic availability** - only shows active event locations
- **Auto-updates** when events start/end

---

## üéÆ **User Experience Flow**

### **Setting Locations**
1. **First use:** Open menu that explains the portals, available upgrades at what levels, etc. Prompt to store first location
2. **Additional locations:** Menu option "Set New Location" 
3. **Location naming:** Auto-generate from zone/area name
4. **Slot management:** Simple list with clear/rename options

### **Teleportation Process**
1. **Use beacon item** ‚Üí Gossip menu opens
2. **Select destination** from saved locations
3. **Cast time:** 3-5 seconds (interruptible) using evocation animation and timing bar
4. **Teleport** to saved coordinates

### **Portal Creation**
1. **Menu option:** "Create Portal to [Location]"
2. **Reagent check:** Confirm portal stone availability
3. **Casting time:** 8-10 seconds
4. **Portal spawn:** 60-second duration, usable by party/raid

### **Instance Access**

2. **Discovery display:** Show only visited instances that have been entered at least once. 
3. **Expansion filtering:** Group by content (Classic, BC, WotLK)
4. **Location Name:** should include instance name, zone, and recommended level

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety & Restrictions**

### **Location Restrictions**
- **Blocked areas:** Battlegrounds, arenas, instance interiors
- **Coordinate validation:** Prevent exploitation or invalid locations
- **Combat protection:** Cannot use while in combat

### **Balance Considerations**
- **Cooldowns:** Prevent rapid teleportation spam
- **Level restrictions:** Higher tiers locked behind progression
- **Resource costs:** Reagents or cooldowns provide limitation

---

## üîß **Implementation Phases**

- Capacity upgrade system (expensive, level-gated)

### **Phase 2: Basic Functionality Upgrades** *(Enhancement)*
- Portal casting upgrade (Level 30+)
- Dungeon access upgrade (Level 15+)
- Capital Networks upgrade (Level 25+)
- Independent upgrade system from capacity

### **Phase 3: Advanced Functionality** *(Advanced)*
